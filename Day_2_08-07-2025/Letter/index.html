            <p>
              <span class="bold">Respected Sir,</span><br />
              I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from college
              for a period of one week, starting from 10th July 2025 to 17th
              July 2025. The reason for my request is that I have been diagnosed
              with typhoid fever and my doctor has advised me to take complete
              rest during this time.
            </p>

            <p>
              I understand the importance of attending classes and keeping up
              with my studies, and I assure you that I will make every effort to
              catch up on any missed assignments or lectures upon my return.
            </p>

            <p>
              I kindly request your understanding and support in granting me
              this leave of absence. I will ensure that all necessary
              documentation from my doctor is provided to the college
              administration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to
              your positive response.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="bold">Sincerely,</span><br />
