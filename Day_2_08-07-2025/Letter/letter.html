      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 08th July 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Leave of Absence</p>
      <p><strong>Respected Sir,</strong></p>
      <p>
        I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from college for a
        period of one week, starting from 10th July 2025 to 17th July 2025. The
        reason for my request is that I have been diagnosed with typhoid fever
        and my doctor has advised me to take complete rest during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand the importance of attending classes and keeping up with my
        studies, and I assure you that I will make every effort to catch up on
        any missed assignments or lectures upon my return.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kindly request your understanding and support in granting me this
        leave of absence. I will ensure that all necessary documentation from my
        doctor is provided to the college administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your
        positive response.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Gourab Majumdar</strong></p>
      <p><strong>CSE 3rd Year</strong></p>
